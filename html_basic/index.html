    <h2>About My Journey</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my progress as a budding web developer through the ALX Freelancing Academy. Joining ALX has been a transformative experience, allowing me to dive into the world of coding, problem-solving, and building real-world projects. My focus has been on mastering HTML, CSS, and other web technologies to create user-friendly, responsive websites.</p>
    
    <h3>My Skills</h3>
    <p>During my time at ALX, I’ve developed a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, enabling me to structure and style web pages effectively. I’ve worked on projects like this portfolio, which demonstrates my ability to create clean, organized code that meets modern web standards. I’m also learning to integrate client feedback, as seen in my freelance website redesign project, to deliver high-quality results.</p>
    
    <p>My journey isn’t just about technical skills—I’m also honing my communication and project management abilities. Through ALX tasks, I’ve learned to craft professional emails, manage project timelines, and handle client expectations, ensuring smooth collaboration and timely delivery. These skills are critical for freelancing success and are a core part of my growth.</p>
